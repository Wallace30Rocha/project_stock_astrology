# Project Objective
"Millionaires don't use astrology, billionaires do". JP Morgan
There are many evidences that the moon, the starts and the sun have a direct influence upon life on Earth and human behavior.

The project was developed is to identify if there is a conection between the stock market (S&P500) and the moon phases, zodiac, lunar and solar eclipses.
We will analyze the daily S&P500 index from 1928 to 2023 and what was happening in the sky during that period.
The goal is to find information that verify the following hypothesis:
1. Full Moon triggers a positive market change.
3. There is a combination between a specific moon phase and zodiac sign that rule the positive market days.
2. Lunar or Solar Eclipses can trigger a crash or a bull run.
3. Lunar and Solar Eclipses have a considerable influence in the volume.
